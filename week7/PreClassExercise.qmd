## Color of Drinking Water 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
```

y \~ Normal (mu, sd)

mu = B0 + B1 \* x

```{r}
# Betas and sigma
beta0 <- 5
beta1 <- -2
sigma <- 1.5

# Predictor (randomly chosen)
x <- rnorm(15, 0, 2)
  
# Response
mu <- beta0 + beta1 * x
y <- rnorm(15, mu, sigma)

mu 

# Visualize
ggplot(tibble(x, y), aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point()

```

y \~ Binomal (1, p)

```{r}
p <- 0.2
violation <- rbinom(100, 1, p)

ggplot(tibble(violation = violation == 1), aes(violation)) +
  geom_bar()
```

violation \~ Binomal (1,p)

p = B0 + B1 \* (PctHisp)

```{r}
# Betas
beta0 <- 0.1
beta1 <- 0.02

# Predictor
pcthisp <- runif(15, 0, 100)

# Response
p <- beta0 + beta1 * pcthisp
violation <- rbinom(15, size = 1, p = p)

print(p)

print(violation)
```

**Look at the simulated outcome, `violation`. What’s wrong with it?**

-   lots of NAs

**Look at the parameter `p`. What’s wrong with it?**

-   p goes over 1.00 = 100% ?

**In one sentence, what’s the challenge here for regression with binary outcomes?**

-   Probably need to be turned into a 0-1 scale

-   I was doing some reading of regression wth binary outcomes and a paper suggested:

    -   To fit model: use glm (instead of lm) with family = "binomal" specified

    -   Pr(binomal cati = 1) = logit(PIi) = PIi = B0 + (B1 \* x) + (B2 \* DV) + (B3 \* x \* DV)
